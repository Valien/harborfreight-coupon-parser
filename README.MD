This simple script takes user input and outputs latest Harbor Freight coupons. :D

To Do:

* Add support for any folder (right now hard-coded to my desktop)
* Possibly remove image count and have it set to x number
* If 20% coupons are specific to 01 then tag those only and do stuff.
* Create a Docker image so those without Python can just run it. Will require Docker.

Please feel free to fork and do a PR if you have some ideas for improvement. This is a quickly hacked script so much to be desired/done on it.

To Run: `pipenv run python3 queryhf.py`

Have fun!!
